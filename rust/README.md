# oab-instance-mcp — Rust / Linux build

Phase 1 of [`docs/adr/linux-rust-port.md`](../docs/adr/linux-rust-port.md): the MCP core
re-implemented in Rust with a Linux backend. Same flags, auth and wire contract as the Swift
build, so callers (kiro-cli, claude, openab) configure it exactly like the Mac one.

| | Swift (macOS) | Rust (Linux) |
|---|---|---|
| MCP Streamable HTTP, sessions, `/healthz` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Auth: `--allow-login` AND bearer token, `--insecure-local` | ✅ | ✅ same decision table |
| `sys_info` | ✅ | ✅ `/proc`, `/sys`, os-release, session env, tailnet IPs |
| `exec`, `exec_start/poll/list/cancel` | ✅ `zsh -f` | ✅ `bash --noprofile --norc`, `setsid` + `killpg` |
| `screenshot` / `mouse` / `key` | ✅ | ✅ xdg-desktop-portal (GNOME verified; KDE should work, untested); same schema and point coordinates. wlroots (grim/ydotool) not yet |
| `osascript` | ✅ | — no Linux equivalent; use `exec` (`gdbus`, `xdg-open`) |
| Reverse attach (`POST/GET /attach`, `DELETE /attach/{id}`, `--no-attach`) | ✅ | ✅ same grant API, close-code policy and backoff; replies are sent concurrently by JSON-RPC id |
| `--upstream` (re-serve Playwright MCP as `browser_*`) | ✅ | ✅ same merge / profile filter / session re-init; `install.sh` sets up Playwright MCP when Node.js is present |

Reverse attach: a human `POST /attach {runtime, session, profile, ttl_secs, secret | admin_credential}`
with the same credential as `/mcp`; this machine dials `{runtime}/tools/attach/{session}` over
`ws://` or `wss://` (rustls, webpki roots) and serves MCP on that socket scoped to the profile.
Under `sandbox` there is no `exec*`; a lent sandbox gets `sys_info`, `screenshot`, `mouse`, `key`
and the allowlisted `browser_*` subset (navigate / read / interact — no `browser_run_code_unsafe`,
file upload, PDF, network inspection, dialogs or `browser_close`).

Desktop (portal backend), verified on GNOME 50 Wayland at 5/3 fractional scaling:

- **Consent once.** The first desktop call shows GNOME's "Remote Desktop" dialog on this
  machine's screen; turn on *Allow Remote Interaction* and Share. The restore token is kept in
  `~/.config/oab-instance-mcp/portal-restore-token` (0600), so later sessions start silently.
  Delete it to revoke. The session closes after 5 min idle (the top-bar indicator goes away).
- **Screenshots** go through the Screenshot portal, which writes a PNG into `~/Pictures`; the
  daemon reads and deletes that file.
- **Pointer on fractional scaling.** The portal validates absolute motion against the logical
  stream size while Mutter reads it in physical pixels, so the daemon moves absolutely as far as
  allowed and finishes with relative motion. Monitor scales come from `org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig`.
- **Typing.** ASCII goes as keysyms; other characters (CJK, accents, symbols) go through the
  IBus/GTK Unicode entry (`ctrl+shift+u`, hex, space), which GTK/Qt apps and browsers accept.
- **Shortcuts** use ctrl; `cmd` is accepted as an alias for ctrl.
- `--no-desktop` turns the three tools off; they are off automatically without a graphical session.
- The service runs with `KillMode=process`, so apps opened via `exec` survive restarts.

Browser (`--upstream browser=http://127.0.0.1:8794/mcp`): `install.sh` installs
`@playwright/mcp` (pinned 0.0.82, as the Swift build) under `~/.local/share/oab-instance-mcp/pw-mcp`
and runs it as the systemd user service `oab-pw-mcp` on loopback only — no auth of its own; the
daemon's auth and profiles front it. The browser is **headed** (a real window on the desktop) with
its own persistent profile, never the user's; it uses the system Google Chrome when present,
otherwise Playwright's Chromium. The daemon re-serves its 32 tools, local names win on collision,
an upstream that is down simply contributes nothing, and a lost upstream session is re-initialized
once. `--no-browser` skips it.

Job logs: `$XDG_STATE_HOME/oab-instance-mcp/jobs/<job_id>.out|.err` (default `~/.local/state/…`).

## Build and test

```sh
cd rust
cargo test
cargo build --release
```

## Install on a Linux desktop

```sh
rust/deploy/install.sh                    # allow-login defaults to this node's Tailscale login
```

It builds the release binary into `~/.local/bin`, creates `~/.config/oab-instance-mcp/token`
(mode 600, kept across re-installs), installs and starts the systemd **user** service
`oab-instance-mcp` bound to `127.0.0.1:8795`, and runs
`tailscale serve --bg --https=8444 http://127.0.0.1:8795` so callers reach it at
`https://<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8444/mcp` with the Tailscale identity injected.
`tailscale serve` needs operator rights once: `sudo tailscale set --operator=$USER`.

It also publishes a tailnet-only **plain-HTTP twin** at `http://<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8080/mcp`
(`--http-port 0` to skip). Same auth; the tailnet is WireGuard-encrypted. It exists for callers
that reach the tailnet through an HTTP proxy — e.g. an agent on a PaaS (Zeabur, Fly, …) next to a
userspace `tailscale` container with `--outbound-http-proxy-listen`: such a caller sets only
`HTTP_PROXY`, so its `https://` traffic (LLM APIs, the web) stays direct.

Caller config:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http <name> https://<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net:8444/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.config/oab-instance-mcp/token)"
```

### Private LAN deployment (no Tailscale, Linux only)

Use LAN mode to bind directly to a private interface/IP:

```sh
rust/deploy/install.sh --lan --bind-host 192.168.1.40 --bind-port 8795 --no-browser
```

- The service runs with `--host <LAN_IP> --port <LAN_PORT>`.
- `--token-file ~/.config/oab-instance-mcp/token` is always passed by the install script.
- In `--lan` mode, the install script also sets `--no-attach` (one-way client → Linux MCP only).
- On non-loopback binds, the daemon refuses to start unless a bearer token is configured.
- Do not hardcode token values or LAN IPs in source code.

MCP URL format:

- `http://<LAN_IP>:<LAN_PORT>/mcp`

Bearer-token configuration:

- Token file path: `~/.config/oab-instance-mcp/token` (mode `600`)
- MCP header: `Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.config/oab-instance-mcp/token)`

Required firewall rule (example):

```sh
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 8795 proto tcp
```

How to test the endpoint:

```sh
curl -i "http://192.168.1.40:8795/healthz"
curl -i -X POST "http://192.168.1.40:8795/mcp" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.config/oab-instance-mcp/token)" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{}}'
```

Verify LAN service args (bearer token + no reverse attach):

```sh
systemctl --user cat oab-instance-mcp.service | grep ExecStart
# Must include both:
#   --token-file %h/.config/oab-instance-mcp/token
#   --no-attach
```

How to disable LAN access:

- Rebind to loopback only: `rust/deploy/install.sh --bind-host 127.0.0.1 --bind-port 8795`
- Or remove firewall allow rule (example): `sudo ufw delete allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 8795 proto tcp`

Network behavior: normal MCP calls are request/response only. The daemon does not initiate a
connection back to the caller unless reverse attach (`/attach`) or an upstream MCP (`--upstream`)
is explicitly configured.

Logs: `journalctl --user -u oab-instance-mcp -f`.
